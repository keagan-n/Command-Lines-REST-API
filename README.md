# Command-Lines-REST-API
.NET backend project where REST API is created that can successfully perform HTTP methods on SQL database containing list of command line commands


Since this was a backend project, I worked with Postman to visualize the data and endpoint requests.

For example, here is a screenshot of a successful GET request of all the values in the database:

This screenshot is a corresponding image of the local database I used with its default values for the above request:
