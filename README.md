# Command-Lines-REST-API
.NET backend project where REST API is created that can successfully perform HTTP methods on SQL database containing list of command line commands


The essence of this project was to create a Model/Controller architecture as shown in this image:

Since this was a backend project, I worked with Postman to visualize the data and endpoint requests.



For example, here is a screenshot of a successful GET request of all the values in the database:

This screenshot is a corresponding image of the local database I used with its default values for the above request:
